# AI-recipe-gen

The purpose of the project is to explore and determine which RNN variation produces more coherent and contextually appropriate cooking recipes. The functionality involves training models on a dataset of recipes, optimizing the architecture for natural language generation, and ultimately generating new, unique recipes.

To set up and run the project successfully, follow these general steps:

## Environment Setup (Locally):

Install Python (a version compatible with the libraries used in the notebook).
Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies (python -m venv venv).
Activate the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate on Unix/macOS or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows).
Install the required libraries  tensorflow and numpy

# OR

## Hosted setup:

We used Colab while developing this project which took us couple of hours to train models, but was not super smooth, other options are available e.g. kaggle.
